uninteractive interactive fiction

You know the problem with [interactive fiction](https://en.wikipedia.orge/wiki/Interactive_fiction)? It's just TOO interactive.

I mean that literally. Sometimes I get an itch for a _proper_ Choose Your Own Adventure experience. You know the kind, the ones that say

> If you dodge to the left, turn to page 112.
> If you dodge to the right, turn to page 150.

every so often.

Sure, I could go find [a childhood classic](https://www.amazon.com/Night-Werewolf-Woods-Yourself-Goosebumps/dp/059067319X), but I've already read that a bazillion times (and that classic done-for-cheap Scholastic binding is beginning to come apart too).

Plus, writing a piece of interactive fiction is a solved issue. They have fancy things like dynamic choices, variables (_have_ you found the key for that locked door? No cheating!), loops, things like that. Interactivefictionsmiths can even see if there's any loose ends, if there are any logic bugs, and they also have pretty flow graphs sometimes.

Meanwhile, for those of us who want to go and write a piece of uninteractive interactive fiction, we're bereft of tools: the best we can do is use anchor links in Markdown and do a lot of rereading to hope everything makes sense. Which, if you only want a few endings, or your story isn't that involved, is probably fine.

Anyway. This is my take on "what if you could export inform/ink/twine/etc to PDF as well as web?"
